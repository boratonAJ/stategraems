### Welcome to STATegraEMS v1.0 documentation.

**Note**: this documentation is temporal, we still developing the tool and we'll fill this documentation as soon as we release a first version.

**STATegraEMS** is an Experiment Management System (EMS) for omics experiments that supports different types of sequencing-based assays, proteomics and metabolomics data. We specifically support experiments such as RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, Chip-seq, Methyl-seq, or DNase-seq and can easily be extended to support additional sequencing assays. 
The system has been developed to provide research laboratories with an integrated system that offers a simple and effective way for experiment annotation and tracking of analysis pipelines from raw data to ready-to-use measurements, using free, open source software technologies.
